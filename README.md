Welcome to the UpsShipping SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the UpsShipping SDK in your project.

## Versions

- SDK version: `1.0.0`

## About the API

Prepare your package for shipment, manage returns, and cancel scheduled shipments. In order to obtain your bearer token please follow the instructions at https://developer.ups.com/get-started, or use the UPS Authorization API.

## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ups-shipping-client
```

## Authentication

### Basic Authentication

The UpsShipping API uses Basic Authentication.

You need to provide your username and password when initializing the SDK.

#### Setting the Username and Password

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the username and password as follows:

```py
UpsShipping(
    username="YOUR_USERNAME",
    password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
)
```

If you need to set or update the username and password after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_basic_auth("YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_PASSWORD")
```

## Using Union Types

Union types allow you to specify that a variable can have more than one type. This is particularly useful when a function can accept multiple types of inputs. The Union type hint is used for this purpose.

### Example Function with Union Types

You can call service method with an instance of `TypeA`, `TypeB`, or a dictionary that can be converted to an instance of either type.

```python
# Model Definition
ParamType = Union[TypeA, TypeB]

# Service Method
def service_method(param: ParamType):
...

## Usage
type_a = TypeA(key="value")
type_b = TypeB(key="value")

sdk.service.service_method(type_a)
sdk.service.service_method(type_b)
sdk.service.service_method({"key": "value"})
```

You cannot create an instance of a `Union` type itself. Instead, pass an instance of one of the types in the `Union`, or a dictionary that can be converted to one of those types.

## Services

The SDK provides various services to interact with the API.

## Models

The SDK includes several models that represent the data structures used in API requests and responses. These models help in organizing and managing the data efficiently.
